# paintworklet_starfield
An experiment with the Houdini CSS Painting API to generate an old school scrolling starfield effect on any element

## Run

The experiment needs to be served via https.
I use [ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) but you can use whichever solution you prefer.

With ```ws```, from the source folder, run:

```
$ ws --https
```
